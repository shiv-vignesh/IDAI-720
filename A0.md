## Github Basics

### 0. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and create your [Github](https://github.com/) account.
 - Skip this step if you already have one.

### 1. Create a new PRIVATE repository named **IDAI-720** under your Github account.
 - (1) Click on the **new** button:
 
 - (2) Initiate the new private repo:
 
 - (3) Invite the instructor and the TA as collaborators (GitHub ID: **azhe825, monoshizmkhan**)

### 2. Clone the created repo to your local machine.
 ```
 git clone THE-REPO-URL
 ```

### 3. Save username and token in git.
 - Create your personal access token on [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
 - Copy the generated token.
 - In terminal:
 ```
 git config --global credential.helper manager
 ```
 - When running this command, the first time you pull or push from the remote repository, you'll get asked about the username and your token (NOT Password!). Afterwards, for consequent communications with the remote repository you don't have to provide the username and password.

### 4. Working with a github repo.
 - (1) Go to the local directory of the **IDAI-720** repo.
 - (2) Pull from Github so that the content on your local machine is updated with the remote server of Github:
 ```
 IDAI-720> git pull
 ```
 - (3) Work on your local machine (add/remove/edit files under IDAI-720/).
 - (4) Commit to the remote server of Github (upload local changes).
 ```
 IDAI-720> git add .
 IDAI-720> git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"
 IDAI-720> git push
 ```
 
 ### 5. Add your information to [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V_nL3YxqgevpsubZYKrFYXezbM1kMi4OLMY60mxUB0A/edit?usp=sharing)
 - Add your github repo url (along with your RIT identifier and Github ID) to the Google sheet.

## Initialize your repo

- Clone this repo **IDAI-720-Assignments** to your local machine
- Copy everything from this repo to your created **IDAI-720** repo on your local machine
- Push the changes of the **IDAI-720** repo so that it is now **identical** to this repo
- **Attention:** do not add extra layers to the repo- these md files should be at the root directory of your **IDAI-720** repo

## Use the CS Clusters

- Log into one of the three [gpu clusters](https://wiki.cs.rit.edu/index.php/Using_gpu_nodes) assigned to you on the [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V_nL3YxqgevpsubZYKrFYXezbM1kMi4OLMY60mxUB0A/edit?usp=sharing) with your CS Account:
```
ssh CS-ACCOUNT@lovegood.cs.rit.edu
```
- Clone your **IDAI-720** repo
 ```
 git clone THE-REPO-URL
 ```
### Install required packages.

- Follow the instructions on the [wiki](https://wiki.cs.rit.edu/index.php/Using_gpu_nodes) to install miniconda and tensorflow (use _wget_ to download the miniconda)
- Install [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) under the same conda environment tf2_gpu_env
```
conda install pandas
conda install pillow
```
