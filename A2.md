### 0. Complete the active learning code

- Complete the active_query() function in [src/vgg_pre.py](src/vgg_pre.py#L131C9-L131C21).
- This function should take inputs from the [pool.csv](data/pool.csv) file and output the top K most uncertain ones with the current model.

### 1. Annotate more data with active learning
- Execute [A2_query.py](src/A2_query.py) file to move 10 unlabeled data points from pool.csv to train.csv.
- Annotate the additional 10 data points from train.csv in the same way as Assignment 1.

### 2. Update the VGG-16 model with the newly labeled data
- Execute [A2_train.py](src/A2_train.py) file.
- Take a screenshot of the execution result (last 10 lines at least).
- Save the screenshot as _/screenshots/A2_ID.png_ where ID is the index of the repeats.

### Repeat Step 1 and 2 at least 5 times

- Remember to push your code.
