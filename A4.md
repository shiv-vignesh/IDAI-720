### 1. Complete the preprocessing algorithm

- Complete the Reweighing functions in [preprocessor.py](src/preprocessor.py).

### 2. Retrain the VGG-16 model with the sample weights calculated by Reweighing
- Execute [A4.py](src/A4.py) file.
- Take a screenshot of the execution result (last 10 lines at least).
- Save the screenshot as _/screenshots/A4.png_.
- See if the group fairness metrics have been improved by Reweighing.
- Remember to push your code.
